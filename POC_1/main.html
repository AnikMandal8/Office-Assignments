                    <p>HTML is the basic language for web content creation. It is used to create a structure or
                        blueprint of
                        the web documents. There are various tags like
                        < h1>, < p>, and < img> define various content elements. HTML provides hyperlinking using an
                                    anchor tag
                                    (< a> tag) that allows navigation.
                                        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
                                        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and
                                        structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading
                                        Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
                                        render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
                                        a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance

                <div class="css_info">
                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheet. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
                        presentation, including layout, colors,
                        and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed]
                        provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
                        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                        file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
                        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
                        formatting.

                        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                        speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
                        for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

                <div class="js_info">
                    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                        standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                        functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                        styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                        expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                        graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript
                        APIs for I/O.

                        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of
                        some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is
                        Node.js.

            <div class="react_div">

                <div class="react_info">
                    <p>JReact (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript
                        library[3][4] for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta
                        (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[5][6][7]

                        React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with
                        frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering
                        components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other
                        client-side functionality.[8][9] A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts
                        of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
